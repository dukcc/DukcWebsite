# New Website

A brand new website. After making many prototypes, I landed on this unique design.

Each page is accessed from the navigation sidebar, by using the icons. My links are available on the right side, and my work status is on top.

## Original Designs

These are my original designs I made in Figma. The same idea has been kept, but lot's of tweaks have been made to this website.

Landing page with a grid of all my work.

A simple about page that summarizes me and my skills.

The projects page. This page's intention is similar to the landing page, but I meant this one to show some of my other projects, and client work with links.

A simple contact page, similar to the about page. Originally all it had was text, but I've added an email form later on.

And finally, the post page.
