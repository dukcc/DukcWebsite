This year has been amazing! Thank you for all of the support. We've reached 1,000 subscribers on YouTube and reached so many people with the VS Code concept. This reel showcases all of the my best work over the year where I've started designing. It also shows lots of my unreleased work, such as:
-  Morph UI
-  HQHost
-  Streamcenter Hardware
-  A random phone render
-  Floatplane redesign
-  Slate OS

I have lots of ideas for designs and projects in 2024. I also hope to release HQLauncher in 2024, along with some other resources. Next year will be amazing!
