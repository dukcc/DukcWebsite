# Hypercube Website

I designed a minimalist website with a dark theme for Hypercube, a new and exciting Minecraft SMP server. The server is owned by Artsign, and I am an admin there. You should go join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/44mrva5Hxu) here.

I have also coded them the website design, using Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. Visit the website [here](https://www.hypercubemc.com/).
